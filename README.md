# Changing your name in King County, Washington


The first step of your name change is deciding if you want your name change order to be sealed or not.

From [WashingtonLawHelp.org's name change packet](https://www.washingtonlawhelp.org/files/C9D2EA3F-0350-D9AF-ACAE-BF37E9BC9FFA/attachments/392DF2A7-D062-2F32-194A-DF77898A9812/3400en_how-to-get-a-name-change-in-washington-state.pdf):
> **Non-sealed name changes: You file these in District Court.** Most name changes are this
type of “non-sealed” or “public” name change. These name changes will be part of regular
accessible District Court records. Whether these records are online and how they are made
available to the public varies by county. But, the Court may keep some kind of record of
your name change that could be searchable. The District Court forwards the Name Change
Order to the county auditor where it is recorded as a public record. It also means that there
will be other people in the room during your hearing. Usually, these will be other people
asking for name changes. For a non-sealed name change, you will use the name change
forms provided by the District Court.

> **Sealed name changes: You file these in Superior Court**. If you think you might qualify
for a sealed name change, you can file for a sealed name change. This means the court
record will be private or confidential. It also means that you will have to go through special
steps to prove who you are each time you need a copy of your court order. You might want
a sealed name change if you have a fear of harassment or violence. Or, if you just want the
most private and confidential name change that is possible. Once sealed, there is no public
access to any court record of the name change filing, even if the court doesn't approve the
name change.

Sealed name changes are generally allowed via RCW 4.24.130 if the request is related to gender expression or identity as described in RCW 49.60.040.
